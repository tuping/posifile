RUBy DSL to build object representing position files.
Read/write position file have always been a pain. Now it's time to change that.
This library is intended to make it easy to read/write any knd of position file that *meets certain criteria here*
All you have to do is write how each position will be associated to objects attributes.

MyCoolLibrary.validade("path_to/other_file.txt") #check
position_file = MyCoolLibray.new("path_to/file.txt") #load the file

position_file.month #call its attributes

the DSL


#my_cool_Clas
require 'posifile'
class MyCoolClass < Posifile 
	set_data_file "path/to/file.txt"
	set_specification {
											"name"="0..10", 
											"city"=>"11..31",
											"country"=>"32..50"
										}
	#you can put here any other method you 'd like

end

client = MyCoolClass.new
client.name
client.city
cliennt.country
